### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite for me because it was interesting to see how we can calculate the time between any two days. In this activity, my partner and I used what we learned in class to prompt the user to enter two dates and store the inputs. We then used the Julian day formula to calculate the difference between the two days.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites because it was interesting to create a Hi-Lo game from scratch using what I had already learned including if statements, variables, arithmetic operators, and so on. In the assignment, only an empty main() function was provided and we had to design the program ourselves. It was a fun challenge that tested my knowledge and problem-solving abilities.

* Lab 7

    I enjoyed Lab 7, part 2, because it took a great deal of problem-solving and logical thinking. My partner and I had to create a program that used street signs to determine if parking was allowed depending on several arguments. The assignment taught me about input validation, as we had to validate the user-given street, day, hour, and minute, and strongly tested my knowledge on logical and relational operators.
